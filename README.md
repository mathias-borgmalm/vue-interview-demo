# Cat Browser (Code Review Project)
Hi! This is a small project containing some code for a hypothetical web app called Cat Browser. It simply allows the user to click on a cat name, and then see a picture of the cat and read a random cat fact (the cat fact comes from a external public API).

The project is written in **Vue 2** and was scaffolded with **Vite**.

This project exists as part of the interview process for **Nexer**.

## Process
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `npm install` (use a modern Node version (as modern as possible))
3. Optionally start the project with `npm run dev` if you wish (if you want to see what the "app" looks like)
4. Inspect the code (read more below)

## Code review
We want you to do a "code review" of this repository. Read through it, and then **write down notes** of code that looks questionable, strange, or perhaps outright bad. If you can, please also provide suggestions on how the code can be improved.

**NOTE!** You only need to read through the following files:
- `src/components/App.vue`
- `src/components/Cat.vue`
- `src/assets/main.css`

Good luck! ðŸ™Œ
